# Note Taking Config Files

Repository where I store my config files for my note-taking workflow. 

The `latex.json` file contains LaTeX snippets for VSCode, however I found that I didn't like taking notes in pure LaTeX, so I switched to my current Markdown + MathJax note-taking workflow. 

I use Typora as my markdown editor, where the `github.css` is a built-in theme, and `base.user.css` contains my custom configurations, such as fonts, alignment, etc. 

For Latex and general snippets, I use espanso, which uses a yaml config file to generate snippets, triggers, and variables.
